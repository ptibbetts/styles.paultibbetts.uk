This is the styleguide to go with my personal website [https://paultibbetts.uk](https://paultibbetts.uk)

It's built with [Fabricator](https://github.com/fbrctr/fabricator) and is a work-in-progress.

You can view it at [http://ptibbetts.github.io/styles.paultibbetts.uk/](http://ptibbetts.github.io/styles.paultibbetts.uk/) (but unfortunately not at https://styles.paultibbetts.uk - see [here](https://github.com/ptibbetts/styles.paultibbetts.uk/commit/18fa1df4abb43fada365a5af1cd725c3ad8016f5) for why)
